1:
First, let's define the main components of the game: the grid, cells(particles), and the environment. The grid will be a two-dimensional list of cells, and each cell 
will have properties such as its position, color, and current state. The environment will include any obstacles or special surfaces that can affect the behavior of the 
cells.

2:
Next, we'll need to define the rules for how the cells will change states. For example, a cell might change color if a certain number of its neighbors are a certain 
color, or it might move in a particular direction if there is an obstacle in its path. We can use a set of if-statements to implement these rules.

3:
Now we can start building the game itself. We'll need to create a loop that updates the state of each cell on the grid based on the rules we defined in step 2. We'll 
also need to handle user input to allow the player to interact with the game (e.g. placing obstacles or changing the color of cells).

Finally, we'll need to add some code to display the game to the player. We can use a library like Pygame to create a window and draw the cells on the screen.
